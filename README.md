# name

GeoTasker Pjson-PWA is a modern and elaborate platform for management of field activities, consolidating functionality for photo documentation, geolocation tracking, and cloud-based synchronization. All together provide a complex yet friendly experience. It is designed as an application, working perfectly on any device, also working offline and updates in real-time. As of such, the application serves both personal and professional use, as tasks can easily be scheduled by the users to be of priority at a set deadline between low, medium, or high, complete with reminders of their own. Collaboration and sharing tools make it perfect for use in group projects, and integrations with outside services—such as, of course, Google Maps—make it useful in just about any scenario. GeoTasker PWA is the kind of application aimed at making daily activities easier and guaranteeing an increase in productivity for users.
